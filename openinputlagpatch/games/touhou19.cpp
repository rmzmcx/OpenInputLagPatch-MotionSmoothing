// Unlike the older games, th19 doesn't just run its logic once per rendered frame: each update
// function advances the engine's clock by one frame at a time and only runs the game's logic
// (and renders) once that clock says a frame has passed. How long a frame is comes from a
// hardcoded double holding the frame rate (0x005AA2C0 is 60.0), which is read as
// 1.0 / frame_rate wherever it's needed - that's why the game kept running at 60fps no matter
// what the frame limiter was set to.
//
// Pointing those reads at the limiter's frame rate instead moves the engine's clock (and with
// it the game's speed) to GameFPS, the same thing thprac's FPS option does for th11 and up.
// Each address below is the 4 byte displacement of a MOVSD/DIVSD that reads 0x005AA2C0, so the
// patch only changes which double the instruction reads.
//
// The game's own frame limiter (0x004B6240) reads the same constant, but it's disabled below,
// so it doesn't have to be patched.
